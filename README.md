# SPRING FRAMEWORK DEMO

This repository demonstrates on POJO & Java Beans and different ways to configure and manage beans in Spring applications.

## Projects
### Example 1: POJO and JavaBeans  
- Path: [example-1-pojo-and-java-beans](example-1-pojo-and-java-beans)  
- Purpose: Demonstrates the difference between Plain Old Java Objects (POJOs) and JavaBeans.

### Example 2: Spring Beans with XML Configuration
- Path: [example-2-spring-beans-xml](example-2-spring-beans-xml)
- Purpose: Explores how to define and configure Spring beans using XML configuration files.
- Key Features:
  - Defining beans in demo.xml.
  - Dependency injection using `<property />` and `<constructor-arg />`.
  - Demonstrates the traditional way of configuring Spring applications.
- Learning Objective: Learn how to use XML for bean configuration and dependency injection in Spring.

### Example 3: Spring Beans with Java and Annotation Configuration
- Path: [example-3-spring-beans-java-and-annotation-configuration](example-3-spring-beans-java-and-annotation-configuration)
- Purpose: Showcases modern Spring bean configuration using Java-based Configuration and Annotation-based Configuration.
- Key Features:
  - Bean definitions with `@Bean` in configuration classes.
  - Use of annotations such as `@Component`, `@Service`, and constructor and setters for dependency injection.
  - Demonstrates the primary approach in modern Spring applications.
- Learning Objective: Understand how to configure Spring beans using Java-based and Annotation-based Configuration.
